A nice Air Hockey simulation between two players developed using Python and Pygame.

This game was developed in 2008 for the Operative Systems class at the Universita' Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Brescia, Italy.

This project has been on Google Code for several years, and since people have looked into it I decided to move it on github.

I removed most of the comments because they were in Italian, sorry about that.

I hope it can be useful for someone who has to work around university projects or just have fun.

Enjoy.
